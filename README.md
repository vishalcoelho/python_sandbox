# Template for all Python Projects

This is a template repository for all of my Python projects. I use virtualenv to create a contained environment for all my Python packages, which i manage with pip. I use GitHub Codespaces to create a remote online instance of Visual Studio Code to run my programs

*GitHub Codespaces is free to use--for education--at the time of writing*

## Steps

1. Create a repsitory using this one as a template
2. Create a GitHub codespace

3. Open a teminal in the VSC instance and verify the virtualenv was sourced
